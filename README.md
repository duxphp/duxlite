# DuxLite Skeleton

The current repository is a project skeleton program for Duxlite.

# Info

DuxLite is a web application development framework based on SlimPHP, which integrates Eloquent ORM as the main data driver. DuxLite also integrates mainstream components standardized by major Psr specifications, such as PSR-7, PSR-11, PSR-15, etc., to ensure the framework has a high degree of scalability and interoperability. DuxLite does not overly encapsulate, making it easy for developers to flexibly choose and upgrade versions, while adopting the application modular design of DuxGo version. The framework's unified entry management facilitates the overall architecture and management of the application, and it can also easily run in asynchronous modes such as Swow and Workerman in the later stage.
